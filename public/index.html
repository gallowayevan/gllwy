    <notes>Started out working in neurobiology. This has a couple consequences for future career
      - I learned the basic of how to program, mostly doing bioinformatics type stuff.
      - I learned the value of well designed data visualization. One of the researchers I worked for (who co-wrote the
      paper form which this diagram from) told me he almost always only looked at figures . . . Power of visualization.

      Work for program on health workforce. Do a mix of data analysis and visualization.
      The program does research on the health workforce, physicians, nurses, dentists, etc but we also collect and house
      a 40+ year set of data.

      Histogram gives sense of relationship between distribution and colors. Use spark chart type layout for compact
      display. Also dont have to interact to get a lot of information. Can see begin and end values.
      Select year, geo, layers (urban layer). Download image, csv of data.

      Built using Vue.js and whole website is a static website built with Hugo and hosted on netlify.

      The website also has some blog posts, with usually static graphics.
      Also some other interactive. Favorite is this D3 chart I built using data on the age and number of health
      providers in rural and metro areas.

      I like having these little inset maps as reference. I like the transitions, including the text transition.

        </a></small>
    <notes>
   New version of website is in development. This version uses Sveltekit which is a javascript framework that differs from Svelte in including things like routing that you might want to build a more complete website.

   The whole website has been rewritten but mostly looks the same. One of the main benefits is less context switching. Previously I was switching between the Hugo build process and the Vue codebase for the visualization. Now, I can stay primarily in Svelte and javascript land for developing the website, which makes things easier. Also, I can do dynamic routing for the supply viz, which I'm excited about. This is potentially very useful, as we have heard that people would like to share direct links to specific professions and/or counties. The visualizations here are built using the Obervable Plot library and are mostly here to test that things are wired up correctly (e.g., the page is correctly pulling data from the database). However, I think I am going to go back to a more expansive layout. There is a lot of detail we are not able to convey in the compact dashboard layout. For instance, we are seeing an increasing amount of missingness for certain variables, like race, and we want to show that an convey caution when interpreting the percentage undderrepresented.

   I'll talk more about Observable Plot, but my plan is to use it as much as possible vs building my own charts using D3 and Svelte, mostly to make things more maintainable and obvious to other developers.

        <notes>
          Based on ACS data.
    Increasingly used in research as goto index. Also used by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for some payment models, i.e., increasing payments based on deprivation.
Neat because it is block group level (which they call neighborhood.) Also this this basic map has been good for spreading it.
    However, recently came under scrutiny because of concerns that non-normalized housing components might be making certain areas look less deprived. Skewed towards less urban areas.

          <notes>
  Another index that has been used a lot is the CDC's tract and county based Social Vulnerability Index. Has more components. Includes race and ethnicity as a component. More straight-forward in everything just being percentile ranked and added up. Also note that these is nothing like Median Home value that would skew away from urban areas. Instead they have things like housing cost burden and multi-unit structures. 

  Now, I am somewhat agnostic about which of these is better. I think you just have to thing about how you are going to use and interpret these. But it seemed clear that these much diverge a fair amount. So I made a map to take a look.

      <notes>
  This comparison is not perfect because I had to have block groups inherit the SVI from their containing tracts. I like in the SVI that you can see what components are pulling things in a certian directions. (look near downtown chapel hill)
Look in NYC too.
