<DD>Population change impacts almost every aspect of global change from land use, to greenhouse gas emissions, to biodiversity conservation, to the spread of disease. Data on spatial patterns of population density help us understand patterns and drivers of human settlement and can help us quantify the exposure we face to natural disasters, pollution, and infectious disease. Human populations are typically recorded by national or regional units that can vary in shape and size. Using these irregularly sized units and ancillary data related to population dynamics, we can produce high-resolution gridded estimates of population density through intelligent dasymetric mapping (IDM). The gridded population density provides a more detailed estimate of how the population is distributed within larger units. Furthermore, we can refine our estimates of population density by specifying uninhabited areas which have impacts on the analysis of population density such as our estimates of human exposure. In this study, we used various geospatial datasets to expand the existing specification of uninhabited areas within the United States (US) Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) EnviroAtlas Dasymetric Population Map for the conterminous United States (CONUS). When compared to the existing definition of uninhabited areas for the EnviroAtlas dasymetric population map, we found that IDM's population estimates for the US Census Bureau blocks improved across all states in the CONUS.

<DD>Here's a surprisingly useful question to ask yourself next time you're stumped by a problem, daunted by a challenge, or stuck in a creative rut: &quot;What if this situation is even worse than I thought?&quot;

This question, I admit, appeals to my taste for bloodyminded contrarianism. But its real value is that it expresses what I think of, more and more, as a fundamental truth about human psychology: that we often make ourselves miserable – and hold ourselves back from what we might be capable of achieving – not because we're too pessimistic, but because, in a sense, we're not pessimistic enough.

<DD>This topic is inspired by a recent exchange on the Adult Beginners Forum. No need to name names, but hopefully all interested parties will at least read this thread.

The question is, if someone came up to you and asked you for advice on how to get started. What would you tell them? What have others told you? What helped? What didn't help?

I know that some here feel like they are still beginners, but imagine someone writes to you and says they admire your latest piece, and then asks the question. How do you respond?

<DD>Many novice composers and songwriters seem to expect that if they keep studying something will come to them. No it won't. Don't wait for inspiration, start working on the craft.

If a person has no idea how to start, there are any number of exercises I have used and suggested for others:
1) Try to replicate music you don't know well. It might be from a TV commercial, or a movie, or a pop song on the radio. Most beginners will not do so accurately, but that isn't the point of the exercise. Focus on mood and tempo. Keep playing notes until the melody seems pleasing. Again, don't worry if it matches the original or not, better if it doesn't. Record what you have. Odds are it will be a derivative and original piece.

2) Start with lyrics. You say you have words, write them down. It is not magic that makes a song. It is two verses and a chorus. Maybe 20 lines of prose all together. Sing them out loud, and record that. Try and match the melody. If you can't sing them, it probably isn't a song. Edit down the words, replace words, doesn't matter if it is proper English, many songs have dangling participles and worse. Again, just do it.

3) Work on a melody line to lyrics. If a person doesn't have any lyrics. Go to the MusesMuse forum and find some good lyrics in their monthly song contest and write melody to those lyrics. Keep working for that hour a day until something sounds like music.

4) Once a person has a melody line, start with simple harmonies. A beginner might start with simple triad chords in the same key, or even single or two-note harmonies. A pianist with more than a year of experience can do this, it isn't difficult. If a person feels lost, get a fake book and look at the simple harmonies in there and emulate. Many popular songs have three or four chords.

It usually doesn't come quick. It may take many hours or days to get a decent melody line. Most of us will never work as fast as Elton John (look up some of his workshops on YouTube, it is amazing), but no matter. Record the best of what you have and work on it the next day.

We start with a set of polygon shapes. Some are simple, single polygons ('bird' and 'house'), others comprise multiple polygons ('triangles') or geo-polygons ('londonCoords'). For convenience, all shapes are scaled to fit within coordinate space [0,0] to [1,1]. Although this is not a requirement, it helps when morphing between shapes that they occupy similar regions of screen space.

<DD>What are they? A center of population represents the mean location of residence for an area’s population, roughly the average latitude and longitude, adjusting for the curvature of the earth. For the last three decennial censuses (2000, 2010, 2020), the Census Bureau has published centers of population separately for U.S. states, counties, census tracts, and block groups.

Where can you get them? Through the Census Bureau website, you can download files containing the latitude and longitude coordinates for centers of population. To facilitate mapping and analysis, IPUMS NHGIS has transformed the coordinates into point shapefiles, available for download through the NHGIS Data Finder.

What are they used for? At the moment, not much! But there are dozens of settings where they’d be helpful. I’m hoping this blog will help get the word out, and if it does, you might now be reading this in some future age, marveling how we ever went so long without using them!

OK, how should we use them? In the case of statistical maps—my focus here—centers of population are wonderfully effective for placing proportional symbols. I share lots of examples down below to demonstrate, but first, let’s consider the general advantages of proportional symbol maps compared to a more common alternative: choropleth maps…

<DD>Rural migration is an integral component of land systems, altering land management both at the origin and destination of migration in regions of Europe and North America. We examine population moving in and out of rural areas in Ohio, U.S.A, between 2008 and 2016 and examine spatiotemporal patterns in land cover. Among families changing residential location, one-third of all household moving events are migration from or to rural areas. A PCA ordination and cluster analysis of rural migration revealed qualitatively distinct patterns. Urban peripheries grew due to in-migration from metro suburban areas, while agricultural and forested areas reflect intra-rural and micropolitan migration. Forested communities have lost population to other rural areas, and rural poverty pockets have gained low-income families from both rural and metro urban areas. Spatial analysis of rural migration patterns and associations with land use helps develop targeted land management strategies and reveals under-represented dynamics in prior studies.

<DD>Each of us can ride the waves of attachments and urges, hoping futilely that someday, somehow, we will get and keep that satisfaction we crave. Or we can take a shot at free will and self-mastery. It’s a lifelong battle against our inner caveman. Often, he wins. But with determination and practice, we can find respite from that chronic dissatisfaction and experience the joy that is true human freedom.

<DD>In my last post I gave you a way to check for yourself, using observations that are easy but were unavailable to ancient scientists, that the Earth is rotating from west to east. The clue comes from the artificial satellites and space junk overhead. You can look for them next time you have an hour or so under a dark night sky, and if you watch carefully, you’ll see none of them are heading west. Why is that? Because of the Earth’s rotation. It is much more expensive to launch rockets westward than eastward, so both government agencies and private companies avoid it.

In this post I want to describe the best proof I know of that the Earth rotates daily, using something else our ancestors didn’t have. Unlike the demonstration furnished by a Foucault pendulum, this proof is clear and intuitive, involving no trigonometry, no complicated diagrams, and no mind-bending arguments.

<DD>One of the most popular features of PostGIS 2.5 was the introduction of the &quot;vector tile&quot; output format, via the ST_AsMVT() function.

Vector tiles are a transport format for efficiently sending map data from a server to a client for rendering. The vector tile specification describes how raw data are quantized to a grid and then compressed using delta-encoding to make a very small package.

Prior to ST_AsMVT(), if you wanted to produce vector tiles from PostGIS you would use a rendering program (MapServer, GeoServer, or Mapnik) to read the raw data from the database, and process it into tiles.

Vector tiles are used by many in-browser/app renderers, and can also power server-side raster rendering. They enable on-the-fly style changes and greater interactivity, while imposing less of a storage burden. You can output them to individual files, or to a SQLite (.mbtiles) database.

<DD>In the late 1970s in the south of France, Pretôt dreamed of gliding over the blue waters of the Sorgues on a traditional lightweight wooden fishing boat called a négo chin—Provençal for “drown the dog,” a reference to its inherently unstable low and flat-bottomed shape. Alas, the boat was a rarity at the time, and there was no one to build one for him. So began his quest to learn and revive the forgotten craft. Now, 45 years later, Pretôt has built more than 100 of the boats, and played a significant role in reviving the fishing culture that founded the village of L’Isle-sur-la-Sorgues.

<DD>Git is a commonly used decentralized source code repository. It was created by the Linux creator Linus Torvalds for the management of the Linux kernel source code. Whole services like GitHub are based around it. So, if you want to program in the Linux world or use IBM’s DevOps Services with Git, it helps to have a good understanding of Git.

When I started working with Git I had some experience with Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Apache Subversion (SVN), so I tried to understand it in terms of those classic source code repository systems. That way of thinking only got me a limited understanding of Git’s capabilities. Since then I have grown to understand Git much better, so this article is a kind of “note to self” text to remind myself how Git works and explain it to those who are new to it. I assume you know your way around other more classical source code repositories like CVS or SVN.

<DD>There’s a phrase going around that you should “buy experiences, not things.”  People, it’s claimed, think that having a lot of stuff is what’s going to make them happy.  But they’re mistaken.  A Lamborghini may be fun to drive for the first days or weeks, but pretty soon it fades into the background of your life.  The drive to accumulate stuff is an evolutionary relic that no longer fits our modern situation.  Better to embrace minimalism and focus on immaterial things like experiences, whose memories you can treasure forever.

<DD>The device also easily pairs with the Strava app for providing VO2 Max data for all your trail excursions. It substitutes VO2 max information for the heart rate sensor data in both of these popular exercise programs. The device is portable and lightweight with Wifi and Bluetooth capabilities and is easily worn with a modified 3M mask designed to be comfortable for long term use. I have tested the device for other sports including cross-country skiing and skating but its portability and wireless transmission capacity make it amenable to just about any sport other than swimming. The device also communicates with an App for the iPhone which enables graphing and long term data storage and download for ancillary calculations. The output includes continuous output of VO2, calories consumed, volumes of expired gas, as well as performing such functions as Basal Metabolic Rate. The device is easily made for about $100. Parts are all readily available and the case is 3D printed. It can be assembled in about 10 minutes. We tested the device in a physiology lab against a $60,000 machine and found it gave the about the same results.

<DD>Using topological data analysis (TDA), we can extract meaningful points from a time series. This can be used to simplify a line (to take it from millions of points to a few hundreds), or to add some labels to a chart, highlighting “important” points such as relative extrema.

The approach is inspired by my reading of Paul Rosen (et al.)’s “LineSmooth: An Analytical Framework for Evaluating the Effectiveness of Smoothing Techniques on Line Charts” (PDF) and “TopoLines: Topological Smoothing for Line Charts”, (PDF), both published in 2020. But I cannot guarantee that my implementation matches their paper (in fact, it certainly doesn’t, since I cut a few corners: I didn’t implement the “fake infinite” points at the start and end of the series, and I'm not 100% sure that my feature-merging algorithm is correct. If you see how to fix this, please send suggestions).

<DD>Every year, around this time, social media begins to rumble in uproar over Bradford Pear (Pyrus calleryana). With headlines like &quot;The Curse of the Bradford Pear,&quot;  &quot;Bradford pear tree: How the trees can hurt people, then environment,&quot; and finally &quot;I Just Hate Bradford Pear,&quot; it's no wonder people have it out for them. The trees have NO GOOD PRESS and, unfortunately, it’s much easier for hoards of people to fall in line with anti-invasive rhetoric than to understand who or what they are trying to demonize.  In light of this, the time has come to take a stand for this poorly misunderstood tree.

Bradford pear belongs to the species Pyrus calleryana, which is why it is sometimes called “Callery.” This species of pear is native to China, where the range goes from sea-level to 5000 feet in elevation, spanning a thousand miles inland as the crow flies. Cousins of callery pear are also in Northern Korea and Japan, showing an immense climate and site adaptability for the species.

An eInk screen doesn’t use any power to maintain its picture, at the cost of taking some time to refresh the picture (15 seconds in the case of this screen). The screen came with Girl Reading a Book by Lilla Cabot Perry pre-loaded, which was nice.

<DD>In my previous notebook about how to find the union polygon of overlapping rectangles I've included a polygon corner rounding algorithm as a post-processing step but didn't explain how it worked.

    Drawing a circle using cubic bezier curves, there's a catch
    Placing a point on a line, at some distance from another one

Both of these things are pretty easy to do once you know how, but can be daunting if you do not, so I figured I'd take some time to give you a few details about how the sausage is made while creating rounded corners on arbitrary polygons.

It involves working with vectors, trigonometry, and a few other tricks I'll tell you more about below. But first, let's see what we'll be building:

While the Romans didn't invent concrete, they certainly raised the bar for building with it.

Pouring concrete allowed Roman architects to achieve almost any shape they could imagine, limited only by their ability to construct the wooden forms necessary to mould the rocky slurry. But the arches, vaults and domes that are signatures of Roman buildings were not just flights of fancy.

<DD>In data analysis, we often work with high dimensional datasets, where each data point has many values, or features, associated with it. Sometimes the number of features can even be greater than the number of observations in the entire data set. As we develop new ways of collecting data, we’re gathering more information than ever before, and high dimensional datasets are becoming more and more common. However, one challenge of working with high dimensional datasets is that it can be difficult to create visualizations to understand the data. Each feature represents a dimension of the data, so when we plot a dataset with n features, we end up with an n dimensional plot, which is impossible to visualize. To solve this problem, data scientists often use a technique called dimension reduction to transform the original data into something that is more easily visualized and understood.

<DD>There is a popular belief in neuroscience that we are primarily data limited, and that producing large, multimodal, and complex datasets will, with the help of advanced data analysis algorithms, lead to fundamental insights into the way the brain processes information. These datasets do not yet exist, and if they did we would have no way of evaluating whether or not the algorithmically-generated insights were sufficient or even correct. To address this, here we take a classical microprocessor as a model organism, and use our ability to perform arbitrary experiments on it to see if popular data analysis methods from neuroscience can elucidate the way it processes information. Microprocessors are among those artificial information processing systems that are both complex and that we understand at all levels, from the overall logical flow, via logical gates, to the dynamics of transistors. We show that the approaches reveal interesting structure in the data but do not meaningfully describe the hierarchy of information processing in the microprocessor. This suggests current analytic approaches in neuroscience may fall short of producing meaningful understanding of neural systems, regardless of the amount of data. Additionally, we argue for scientists using complex non-linear dynamical systems with known ground truth, such as the microprocessor as a validation platform for time-series and structure discovery methods.

This is now best known as part of the text analysis technique TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency).

When I was a PhD student, I was a teaching assistant for Karen's class on Information Retrieval, and one of my readings was the technical report Simple, proven approaches to text retrieval, written by Karen and Stephen Robertson. In this notebook, I'll explain some of the concepts from that paper through a series of interactive examples.

More specifically, TF-IDF is a method for term weighting, where each of the documents in a collection is characterized using weights assigned to the words (or terms) present in it. This makes it possible to rank the documents according to their estimated relevance to a search query. These concepts are still relevant to modern search engines and other kinds of text analysis.

The story is the following: the United States has 12 Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) regions that issue $1 notes. A specific mark on each note indicates its provenance. As customers travel around, they carry money and spend it, and the notes diffuse in the country. By counting the notes observed in stores in each of the 12 regions, one can establish an origin/destination matrix, indicating how many notes issued in Boston end up in Chicago, etc.

The interface could also be used with other historical maps and map series metadata, and, more generally, to understand the shape of large-scale polygon datasets distributed over space and time.

The OS, Britain’s national mapping agency, created large numbers of detailed maps from the early nineteenth century. Map series at different cartographic scales, in a sequence of editions, capture snapshots of a changing landscape through time. Macromap visualises data describing these maps, helping us see what is available.

<DD>Throughout the pandemic, each time a public safety measure arrives on the scene, some experts fret that the masses will simply use the newfound sense of security as license to behave recklessly, canceling out or even reversing any benefits of the safety measure. The concept many medical experts can’t seem to loosen their grip on is known as “risk compensation.” It’s an idea that comes from the study of road safety and posits that people adjust their behavior in response to perceived risk: the safer you feel, the more risks you’ll take. Risk compensation makes intuitive sense and can be true to an extent. If you’re driving on a precarious cliff-side road without guardrails, you’d probably drive more cautiously. But some proponents of the idea make a stronger claim: that guardrails cause so much reckless driving that any potential safety benefits of guardrails are offset or even reversed. Under this reasoning, a road with guardrails would cause more accidents than a road without guardrails. Guardrails aren’t helpful; they’re counterproductive.

<DD>I've looked in the past at in-browser analytics of a granular database of college degrees using basic Apache Arrow functions and arquero. This notebook does the same thing using the new duckdb wasm module. At first pass it's a cut above in speed and flexibility, because:

    It can load from compressed parquet files, which allow it to work with larger datasets, faster;
    It can often be about 10x faster than equivalent in-browser solutions if the data is more than several thousand rows.

This means that you can create fast, arbitrary analytic queries across very large datasets in browser. While in my previous runs at this dataset the central joins took around half a second, with duckdb most changes can be reflected in under a tenth of a second; not fast enough for real-time animation, but good enough for most other purposes.

Wikipedia searches are online. There is an added delay after each search to respect rate limits. Thus the code may take several seconds to complete the wikification process. Total time taken will depend on the number of searches required i.e. number of potential entities detected.

<DT><A HREF="https://chrisbutner.github.io/ChessCoach/" ADD_DATE="1633617678" PRIVATE="0" TOREAD="0" TAGS="ai,chess,machine-learning">Overview | ChessCoach</A>
<DD>ChessCoach is a neural network-based chess engine capable of natural-language commentary. It plays chess with a rating of approximately 3450 Elo, which means it should usually beat even the strongest human players at 2850 Elo, and many other engines, but will often lose to the strongest, such as Stockfish 14 at 3550 Elo.

As with all engines, ChessCoach relies on examining millions of chess positions to decide on the best move to play. It uses a large, slow neural network just like AlphaZero or Leela Chess Zero (Lc0) to evaluate each position, unlike classical engines which aim for speed with a much simpler evaluation, or more recent NNUE engines, which are a stronger hybrid of both styles.

The neural network at the core of the engine is trained by playing against itself, using a feedback cycle to start from almost zero knowledge – just the rules of chess – and learn new ways to beat itself as it grows stronger. Stronger neural network evaluations let it search better, and stronger search results let it train its neural network evaluation more effectively.

ChessCoach can also feed its chess knowledge into an additional neural network to comment on moves and positions in English. It is not very insightful and often wrong but shows some promise for the limited data it has been able to train on.

<DD>Geobuf is a compact binary encoding for geographic data.

Geobuf provides nearly lossless compression of GeoJSON data into protocol buffers. Advantages over using GeoJSON alone:

    Very compact: typically makes GeoJSON 6-8 times smaller.
    2-2.5x smaller even when comparing gzipped sizes.
    Very fast encoding and decoding — even faster than native JSON parse/stringify.
    Can accommodate any GeoJSON data, including extensions with arbitrary properties.

The encoding format also potentially allows:

    Easy incremental parsing — get features out as you read them, without the need to build in-memory representation of the whole data.
    Partial reads — read only the parts you actually need, skipping the rest.

Think of this as an attempt to design a simple, modern Shapefile successor that works seamlessly with GeoJSON. Unlike Mapbox Vector Tiles, it aims for nearly lossless compression of datasets — without tiling, projecting coordinates, flattening geometries or stripping properties.

Like this little off hand comment by Bryan Cantrill:

    I write three or four Awk programs a day. And these are one-liners. These super quick programs.

It turns out Awk is pretty simple. It has only a couple of conventions and only a small amount of syntax. As a result, it’s straightforward to learn, and once you understand it, it will come in handy more often than you’d think.

So in this article, I will teach myself, and you, the basics of Awk. If you read through the article and maybe even try an example or two, you should have no problem writing Awk scripts by the end of it. And you probably don’t even need to install anything because Awk is everywhere.

<DD>The AIST++ Dance Motion Dataset is constructed from the AIST Dance Video DB. With multi-view videos, an elaborate pipeline is designed to estimate the camera parameters, 3D human keypoints and 3D human dance motion sequences:

    It provides 3D human keypoint annotations and camera parameters for 10.1M images, covering 30 different subjects in 9 views. These attributes makes it the largest and richest existing dataset with 3D human keypoint annotations.
    It also contains 1,408 sequences of 3D human dance motion, represented as joint rotations along with root trajectories. The dance motions are equally distributed among 10 dance genres with hundreds of choreographies. Motion durations vary from 7.4 sec. to 48.0 sec. All the dance motions have corresponding music.

With those annotations, AIST++ is designed to support tasks including:

    Multi-view Human Keypoints Estimation.
    Human Motion Prediction/Generation.
    Cross-modal Analysis between Human Motion and Music.

<DD>Maps are frequently used to display spatial distributions of parameters of interest, such as cancer rates or
average pollutant concentrations by county. It is well known that plotting observed rates can have serious
drawbacks when sample sizes vary by area, since very high (and low) observed rates are found dispropor-
tionately in poorly-sampled areas. Unfortunately, adjusting the observed rates to account for the e ects of
small-sample noise can introduce an opposite e ect, in which the highest adjusted rates tend to be found
disproportionately in well-sampled areas. In either case, the maps can be dicult to interpret because the
display of spatial variation in the underlying parameters of interest is confounded with spatial variation in
sample sizes. As a result, spatial patterns occur in adjusted rates even if there is no spatial structure in the
underlying parameters of interest, and adjusted rates tend to look too uniform in areas with little data. We
introduce two models (normal and Poisson) in which parameters of interest have no spatial patterns, and
demonstrate the existence of spatial artefacts in inference from these models. We also discuss spatial models
and the extent to which they are subject to the same artefacts. We present examples from Bayesian modelling,
but, as we explain, the artefacts occur generally.

<DD>We consider joint spatial modelling of areal multivariate categorical data assuming a multiway contingency table for the variables, modelled by using a log-linear model, and connected across units by using spatial random effects. With no distinction regarding whether variables are response or explanatory, we do not limit inference to conditional probabilities, as in customary spatial logistic regression. With joint probabilities we can calculate arbitrary marginal and conditional probabilities without having to refit models to investigate different hypotheses. Flexible aggregation allows us to investigate subgroups of interest; flexible conditioning enables not only the study of outcomes given risk factors but also retrospective study of risk factors given outcomes. A benefit of joint spatial modelling is the opportunity to reveal disparities in health in a richer fashion, e.g. across space for any particular group of cells, across groups of cells at a particular location, and, hence, potential space–group interaction. We illustrate with an analysis of birth records for the state of North Carolina and compare with spatial logistic regression.

<DD>Cartography is the study and practice of making maps [41]. This generally in-
cludes data collection, design and construction of maps, and the analysis of maps.
Cartographers aim to make maps that model reality in ways that communicate the
spatial information as effectively as possible. As mentioned above, technological
advances and the changing needs of map users require the automated construction
of maps.
The goal of automated cartography is to automate all tasks that are tradition-
ally performed manually by a cartographer. It involves the design of automated
methods for the visualization of geographic data. Automated cartography is often
considered to be part of geographic information systems [73], or GIS in short. The
acronym GIS also often refers to geographic information science, the scientific field
underlying the development and use of geographic information systems. To avoid
confusion, we use the acronym only for geographic information systems.

<DD>The primary question I am asked that comes with a simple answer.

I just wanted to see what a long bass string sounded like.

It occurred to me that long bass strings sounded better. When I was 14 I asked my piano teacher how long a bass a string would need to be if it had no copper on it at all. The answer was “Adrian the string would be so long it would go on for ever!” so with this in mind I did an experiment where I could find that measurement.

I knocked a waratah (metal fence post) into the ground at both ends and with a big piece of timber with a hole and tuning pin in it I strung up an enormous bass string. After finding a safe tension I tuned it to the lowest A on a piano by moving rocks along the wire.

Here I discovered the most interesting sound and from this point I was determined to build a piano to have the longest string sounding like this. I later did more experimenting. Fifteen year old me said “Mum I’m going to build a piano!”

I think because I was so young I absolutely knew it was totally possible to do, I was fully determined and without consulting any professionals I had no barrier stopping me.

<DD>The Census Bureau released a report on Multidimensional Deprivation in the spring of 2019.  The Multidimensional Deprivation Index (MDI) consists of six dimensions: standard of living, health, education, economic security, housing quality, and neighborhood quality.  One criticism of the MDI is that the neighborhood quality dimension was based on county level data.  In order to be considered a deprived county, the county had to be in the bottom 10 percent of counties, as measured by crime, pollution, and access to food, for at least two out of the three metrics. Six alternative neighborhood quality measures, available at the census tract or block group level, are discussed in this paper.  In order to evaluate these different neighborhood quality measures, three criteria are examined: the geographic level at which the measure is available; the relationship of the neighborhood quality measures to several county level social and economic characteristics; and the relationship of the neighborhood quality measures to tract level social and economic characteristics. Using these criteria, the original measure from the 2019 MDI report performs the worst and the national Area Deprivation Index (ADI) measure performs the best.  When the national ADI is used to measure neighborhood quality, the MDI rate is not statistically different than the original MDI for the United States.  However, the MDI rate is higher than the original MDI in 21 states, lower than the original MDI in 10 states and the District of Columbia, and not statistically different than the original MDI in19 states.

Some features took an hour to implement, some took several hours spread over days, some even stretched into weeks, but it did not matter because there were no deadlines of any sort.

<DD>Political exclusion, or “underbounding” as Aiken (1987) labeled it, occurs when African American neighborhoods are kept just outside of a town’s boundaries, resulting in lower levels of services, reduced access to infrastructure, and limited or no political voice in land-use and permitting decisions.  African American communities are systematically excluded from towns by administrative decisions made by elected and appointed officials and the gerrymandered exclusion of African Americans residents from small towns of the South.

Underbounding occurs when land-use policies and practices result in the systematic exclusion of minority communities from municipal boundaries as cities and towns expand around them.

<DD>This exploration of scales is based in a musical universe founded on two assumptions:

    Octave Equivalence
    We assume that for the purpose of defining a scale, a pitch is functionally equivalent to another pitch separated by an octave. So it follows that if you're playing a scale in one octave, if you continue the pattern into the next octave you will play pitches with the same name.

    12 tone equal temperament
    We're using the 12 tones of an equally-tempered tuning system, as you'd find on a piano. Equal temperament asserts that the perceptual (or functional) relationship between two pitches is the same as the relationship between two other pitches with the same chromatic interval distance. Other tuning systems have the notion of scales, but they're not being considered in this study.

<DD>Photonix is a photo management application that streamlines the process of storing, presenting and re-discovering photos. Once set up it will ingest all the photos in your collection and start building up an image database of everything you could want to search and filter by. It makes your entire collection available to you, whichever device you’re using — as long as you can get to a web browser.

We think Photonix could work well for you if you’re a keen photographer. Its aim is to be invisible to your existing process (downloading photos from your camera, editing and saving) but to be there whenever and wherever you need to find a photo again. Smart filtering means you can get to the photo or album you need. Face recognition, Object detection, location awareness, color analysis and a growing set of other algorithms can save you a lot of time.

<DD>College graduates’ career choices are driven by a complex mixture of factors, one of which is economics. The author comments on the report by Marcu and colleagues in this issue, which focuses strictly on the economics of this decision. Specifically, Marcu and colleagues modeled career choices as long-term financial investments in human capital, which consists of the knowledge and clinical skills physicians gain in undergraduate and graduate medical education. They distill the numerous factors that shape the economics of career choice into a commonly used criterion for long-term financial investments of any kind—namely, the so-called net present value (NPV) of the investment. For them, that investment is the decision to pursue a medical career rather than the next best nonmedical, alternative career. This NPV calculation determines the increase or decrease in wealth, relative to that of the next best alternative career, that a college graduate is thought to experience as of the moment she or he enters medical school simply by choosing a medical career rather than the next best alternative. Marcu and colleagues use this human capital model to explore how different plans to finance a medical school education impact the NPV, all other parameters being equal. The author of this Commentary explains in layman’s terms how the NPV is calculated and then raises a number of other issues concerning the economics of a medical career, including medical school tuition, residents’ salaries, and investments in human capital as tax deductible.

GEOIDs are numeric codes that uniquely identify all administrative/legal and statistical geographic areas for which the Census Bureau tabulates data. From Alaska, the largest state, to the smallest census block in New York City, every geographic area has a unique GEOID. Some of the most common administrative/legal and statistical geographic entities with unique GEOIDs include states, counties, congressional districts, core based statistical areas (metropolitan and micropolitan areas), census tracts, block groups and census blocks.

<DD>“With all the time you spend watching TV,” he tells me, “you could have written a novel by now.” It’s hard to disagree with the sentiment — writing a novel is undoubtedly a better use of time than watching TV — but what about the hidden assumption? Such comments imply that time is “fungible” — that time spent watching TV can just as easily be spent writing a novel. And sadly, that’s just not the case.

Time has various levels of quality. If I’m walking to the subway station and I’ve forgotten my notebook, then it’s pretty hard for me to write more than a couple paragraphs. And it’s tough to focus when you keep getting interrupted. There’s also a mental component: sometimes I feel happy and motivated and ready to work on something, but other times I feel so sad and tired I can only watch TV.

If you want to be more productive then, you have to recognize this fact and deal with it. First, you have to make the best of each kind of time. And second, you have to try to make your time higher-quality.

<DD>Testing is one of those things that you either get super excited about or kinda close your eyes and walk away. Whichever camp you fall into, I’m here to tell you that front-end testing is for everyone. In fact, there are many types of tests and perhaps that is where some of the initial fear or confusion comes from.

I’m going to cover the most popular and widely used types of tests in this article. This might be nothing new to some of you, but it can at least serve as a refresher. Either way, my goal is that you’re able to walk away with a good idea of the different types of tests out there. Unit. Integration. Accessibility. Visual regression. These are the sorts of things we’ll look at together.

And not just that! We’ll also point out the libraries and frameworks that are used for each type of test, like Mocha. Jest, Puppeteer, and Cypress, among others. And don’t worry — I’ll avoid a bunch of technical jargon. That said, you should have some front-end development experience to understand the examples we’re going to cover.

<DD>The best way to get into writing tests is to think about how you check your data interactively to make stuff work. After a merge or egen, most people pause to browse the data and/or watch the code step by step, or do a set of quick tabs or plots.  But these are not systematic, and you generally only do them once (when you’re first writing the code).

A great way to write tests is to think about what you’re looking for when you do these interactive tests and convert the logic of those interactive interrogations into systematic assert statements. That way they’ll be baked into your code, and will be executed every time your code runs!1

    After merge: No where are problems with data made more clear then in a merge. ALWAYS add tests after a merge! More on that below. 
    After complicated commands (like bysort and egen): If you have to think more than a little about how to get Stata to do something, there’s a chance you missed something. Add a test or two to make sure you did it right! Personally, for example, I almost never use bysort or egen without adding tests — it’s just not a natural way to think about things, so I know I may have screwed up (and often have!).
    Before drop if statements: Dropping observations masks problems. Before you drop variables, add a test to, say, count the number of observations you expect to drop (count if CONDITION, then assert r(N) &lt; NUMBER_YOU_EXPECT_TO_DROP, then drop if CONDITION`)
    When using conditions (if statements) with more than one or two simple clauses

<DD>We have been asked about IE11 support since the start of Vue 3's development, tracing back to end of 2018. Many users have asked whether Vue 3 will support IE11, and our original plan was to release Vue 3 and let it stablizie first, and add IE11 support at a later stage. During the long development process, we've also made research and experiments for IE11 compatibility on the side, but due to the complexity involved and amount of other work at hand, it's been de-prioritized down the road.

When we take another look at the problem today in 2021, the browser and JavaScript landscape has changed quite a bit. More developers are now using modern language features, and more importantly Microsoft itself has started to actively push users away from IE with its investment in Edge. It is also dropping IE11 support in its own major projects like Microsoft 365. Just a few days ago WordPress also made the decision to drop IE11 support. IE11's global usage has dropped below 1%. When we are talking about public-facing websites and apps, IE11 is on a clear fast decline.

<DD>Here is one of the most popular recipes The Times has ever published, courtesy of Jim Lahey, owner of Sullivan Street Bakery. It requires no kneading. It uses no special ingredients, equipment or techniques. And it takes very little effort — only time. You will need 24 hours to create the bread, but much of this is unattended waiting, a slow fermentation of the dough that results in a perfect loaf. (We've updated the recipe to reflect changes Mark Bittman made to the recipe in 2006 after publishing and receiving reader feedback. The original recipe called for 3 cups flour; we've adjusted it to call for 3 1/3 cups/430 grams flour.) In 2021, J. Kenji López-Alt revisited the recipe and shared his own tweaked version. —Mark Bittman

“This was the recipe that democratized bread-baking,” says Peter Reinhart, a chef-instructor at Johnson &amp; Wales University and the author of “The Bread Baker’s Apprentice” (Ten Speed Press, 2001).

As a recipe writer, I consider it a win if I can improve an existing technique, either by making it more simple and foolproof, or by tweaking it to produce markedly superior results. The no-knead bread recipe accomplished both of those goals simultaneously. The process is simple: Mix flour, water, salt and yeast in a bowl just until they all come together. Cover the bowl and let it sit on your counter overnight. The next day, shape it into a loose loaf, let it proof, then bake it inside a preheated Dutch oven with the lid on. That’s it.

<DD>The tendency of planning historians to focus on land use regulations principally as a way to shape the built environment and to stabilize land values obscures equally important (and less publicized) social objectives in America's early planning movement. In Zoning and the American Dream,Charles Haar points to the diverse interests that coalesced in the early 1900s to create the &quot;remarkable socio-legislative phenomenon&quot; of zoning. Haar contends that a &quot;ragtag grouping of idealists and special interest groups of the most diverse origins&quot; looked to zoning as a tool for social reform as well as land use control.2These socialreformers believed that zoning offered a way not only to exclude incompat ible uses from resident ial areas but also to slow the spread of slums into better neighborhoods. Reformer/planner Benjamin Marsh championed zoning in the early 1900s in an effort tocombat urban congestion and thereby improve the quality of working-class neighborhoods. Despite the obvious social implications of early zoning initiatives, however, the noblest intent ion of reformers like Marsh soon gave way to political pressures from those less inclined toward broad civic improvement. &quot;What began as a means of improving the blighted physical environment in which people lived and worked,&quot; writes Yale Rabin, became &quot;a mechanism for protecting property values and excluding the undesirables.&quot; The two interest groups that were regarded as the undesirables were immigrants and African Americans.

    It's caused when the Starting Knot &amp; Finishing Bow don't “balance” each other;
    It can be spotted by the tendency of the bow to sit crooked (ie. heel to toe);
    It's fixed by reversing one stage of the knot – most easily the Starting Knot;
    The result is a neat, balanced shoelace bow that keeps your laces tied.

It’s always a good idea to explore lightweight vanilla JavaScript snippets as well — preferably the ones that don’t have any third-party dependencies. Fortunately, there is no shortage in tooling to do just that.

They know exactly what is going to happen, they know the choices, and they generally have access to any sort of medical care they could want. But they go gently.

<DD>HTML and CSS are beautiful languages and one of the landmark achievements of collaboration and the open web. Together, they allow you to create beautifully typeset digital content that can be viewed on any device, without any special software or paid licenses.

The web however was developed for scrolling content, and not paged media (by which we mean discrete pages, like in print or PDF). Unfortunately, whilst there are W3C standards on paged media, adoption by browsers has not been adequate to date. High quality paid alternatives exist in PrinceXML, but a native, free solution has been missing.

A happenstance discussion on Hacker News brought my attention to paged.js, a genius idea to polyfill the required capabilities to allow browsers to natively handle paged media, without having to build the whole rendering engine from scratch.

This guide provides a basic tutorial to using paged.js, for my own future reference and yours, and I highly recommend you visiting their site and supporting their project. In particular, their documentation covers many aspects of advanced paged media and is a worthwhile next step after reading this guide.

<DD>Two years ago, I started at the City of Boston with a simple yet comically broad mandate: Get rid of paper forms and PDFs. The nascent Digital team had launched the beta of boston.gov, and was learning, iterating, and rewriting content to get everything from the older cityofboston.gov moved over to the new boston.gov.

A *lot* of that content was locked up in PDFs. For years, that was the way most information was posted on the old website. Documents that were mostly content were broken down and rewritten, but Lauren Lockwood, the Chief Digital Officer, knew forms would be tougher. That’s why they brought on a single person dedicated to moving those forms online. She nicknamed me the “PDF Killer”, which I sort of hated but will probably love in like 6 months. I just left the City, so it seems like a good time to review what I did and how I did it.

So what is wrong with the definition, “Multiplication is repeated addition”? Perhaps wrong is too strong a word — perhaps in some deep, theoretical sense, the statement is true, at least for the whole numbers — I’ll leave that argument to the mathematicians. (See, for instance, How multiplication is really defined in Peano arithmetic.) But speaking as a teacher, the phrase can definitely be misleading.

<DT><A HREF="https://omarshehata.me/notebook/exploring_sound" ADD_DATE="1614700105" PRIVATE="0" TOREAD="0" TAGS="music,data-visualization">Omar Shehata</A>
<DD>Why does an A note on a piano sound different from an A note on a violin?

From Omar's notebook.

If you pull up a tuner app on your phone and play an A note on a piano, the tuner will say ~440 hz. Do the same thing on a violin's A note and you'll also get 440 hz.

This seemed impossible based on my understanding of sound, which was:

    Our ears perceive sound by picking up on the frequency of the air vibrating around us.
    Two sounds are different if they have different frequencies, in the same way two colors appear different if they emit light of different wavelengths.
    When we say a sound is 440 hz, that means a point vibrating along that sound wave makes a complete cycle 440 times per second.

So if two sound waves have exactly the same frequency, according to my tuner app, they cannot possibly sound different. But they do! Does that mean there's something else, something more than frequency that can differentiate sound?

Throughout the day, I’m supporting students, attending meetings, reading documentation, news articles, programming, learning, using emacs and org-mode to capture information, write down thoughts, create tasks, and conversing with my knowledge management system.

I try to use my e-ink monitor as much as possible throughout the day to reduce eye strain, fatigue and lessen distractions while intermittently taking breaks. The Dasung monitors go a long way to make this possible when I’m home or in a stationary place. Though there are times, I’m not working in front of my desktop or would like to work at a different location.

<DD>REST APIs are one of the most common kinds of web services available today. They allow various clients including browser apps to communicate with a server via the REST API.

Therefore, it’s very important to design REST APIs properly so that we won’t run into problems down the road. We have to take into account security, performance, and ease of use for API consumers. 

Otherwise, we create problems for clients that use our APIs, which isn’t pleasant and detracts people from using our API. If we don’t follow commonly accepted conventions, then we confuse the maintainers of the API and the clients that use them since it’s different from what everyone expects.

In this article, we’ll look at how to design REST APIs to be easy to understand for anyone consuming them, future-proof, and secure and fast since they serve data to clients that may be confidential.

Because there are multiple ways a networked application can break, we should make sure that any REST APIs handle errors gracefully using standard HTTP codes that helps consumers deal with the problem.

2018 Update: The 2018_dep_index folder contains an version of the same deprivation index, but updated with data from the 2018 5-yr American Community Survey data. See the 2018 README for details on getting and using the data at the census tract and ZIP code level.
Overview

Socioeconomic variables from the American Community Survey (ACS) are frequently used in place of or in addition to individual confounders in observational studies. There are several census tract level measures that can be used to capture &quot;community deprivation&quot; and they are often highly correlated, e.g., median household income and educational attainment. Choosing only one ACS measure might not capture the entirety of community deprivation, but using more than one ACS measure can lead to problems in statistical models due to colinearity.

Here, we create a deprivation index for each census tract in the United States based on a principal components analysis of six different 2015 ACS measures. The first component explains over 60% of the total variance present in the five different ACS measures and is dubbed the &quot;Deprivation Index&quot;. Rescaling and normalizing forces the index to range from 0 to 1, with a higher index being more deprived.

<DD>No, interactive graphics are not dead. It is also not true that “85% of the Times‘ page visitors online simply ignore interactive infographics altogether”. But since I sort of helped creating[1] this confusion, I think it’s time to set this straight:

    Interactive graphics are still great, and there are a lot of good reasons to make them!

Knowing that the majority of readers doesn’t click buttons does not mean you shouldn’t use any buttons. Knowing that many many people will ignore your tooltips doesn’t mean you shouldn’t use any tooltips. All it means is that you should not hide important content behind interactions. If some information is crucial, don’t make the user click or hover to see it (unless you really want to). But not everything is crucial and 15% of readers isn’t nobody. So there is a lot we can do with interaction, and I am going to point out three examples below. By Gregor Aisch

<DD>I’ve never made my own recipe before and while I wish you could taste it, you can have the next best thing - the recipe! I added two ingredients for some extra flavor that aren’t part of my model inputs (vanilla extract and chocolate chips), but the rest adhered strictly to what my model told me would be 50% cake, 50% cookie. I present to you the cakie.
Cakie
Ingredients

    ½ cup + ¾ tablespoon butter, cold
    ¼ cup granulated sugar
    ¼ cup brown sugar, packed
    1 large egg
    ¼ cup olive oil
    ⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract
    1 cup flour
    1 teaspoon baking powder
    ¼ teaspoon salt
    ¼ cup chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 6-inch cake pan with cooking spray or butter. If you don’t have a 6-inch cake pan, a loaf pan will probably work too (let me know if you try this!).

Cut the butter into pieces and place into a mixer. On medium speed, mix the butter until smooth. Add in both sugars and mix until combined. Then add the egg, oil, and vanilla extract.

In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, and salt. Slowly incorporate it into the butter mixture, mixing on low speed until just combined. Mix in chocolate chips if you like them.

Bake for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Unlike I did, let the cakie cool in the pan for at least 20 minutes before removing it.

<DD>Stork is two things that work in tandem to put a beautiful, fast, and accurate search interface on your static site. First, it's a program that indexes your content and writes that index to disk. Second, it's a Javascript library that downloads that index, hooks into a search input, and displays optimal search results immediately to your user, as they type.

Stork is built with Rust, and the Javascript library uses WebAssembly behind the scenes. It's built with content creators in mind, in that it requires little-to-no code to get started and can be extended deeply. It's perfect for JAMstack sites and personal blogs, but can be used wherever you need a search interface.

<DD>Welcome to Naismith International Park. Created by Kirk Goldsberry this topographic map features statistical insight, basketball legends, and decades of hoops history. Sized 18&quot; x 24&quot;, Giclée printing quality on 70lb. matte paper.

From Kirk: &quot;This map blends two of my passions: cartography and hoops. The elevation surface on the map is derived from the most common scoring areas in the NBA during the 2019-20 season. Higher places indicate the areas where NBA scorers scored the most from. Naturally this includes the areas near the rim and the areas just outside the 3-point line. 

The original plan was to make a fun map poster emphasizing the best scorers from the 2019-20 season, but the project quickly spiraled out of control as I started to label more and more historic places. 

The inspiration for the cartographic style here comes from the beautiful map series designed and distributed by the US National Park Service, which is also why I named this project the Naismith International Park map. 

My goal was to honor as many of the legends of the game as possible in appropriate ways. It was an impossible goal, and I know I missed some huge names - for that I’m sorry. Still, I’m really happy with how the project turned out and hope you enjoy looking at it as much as I enjoyed making it!&quot;

<DD>Then came the second breakthrough. In 2009, Commins and his colleagues found that 24 patients at the University of Virginia allergy clinic in Charlottesville had IgE antibodies against α-gal2 — and all of them had shown allergic reactions within three to six hours of eating mammalian meat. Just a few months later, van Nunen and her colleagues published a paper on the association between mammalian-meat allergy and tick bites3, and the pieces of this food-allergy puzzle finally fell into place. In the southeastern United States, just as in Sydney, a tick was the key.

“The tick is altering us,” van Nunen says. When a tick bites a person, it introduces α-gal to the human immune system, which in some people leads to the development of an allergy to mammalian meat products. Exactly how this happens, however, is still shrouded in mystery.

<DD>ens of thousands of ice age paintings across a cliff face shed light on people and animals from 12,500 years ago

One of the world’s largest collections of prehistoric rock art has been discovered in the Amazonian rainforest.

Hailed as “the Sistine Chapel of the ancients”, archaeologists have found tens of thousands of paintings of animals and humans created up to 12,500 years ago across cliff faces that stretch across nearly eight miles in Colombia.

Their date is based partly on their depictions of now-extinct ice age animals, such as the mastodon, a prehistoric relative of the elephant that hasn’t roamed South America for at least 12,000 years. There are also images of the palaeolama, an extinct camelid, as well as giant sloths and ice age horses.

More importantly, it's a case study showing that vanilla web development is viable in terms of maintainability, and worthwhile in terms of user experience (100% faster loads and 90% less bandwidth in this case).

There's no custom framework invented here. Instead, the case study was designed to discover minimum viable patterns that are truly vanilla. The result is maintainable, albeit verbose and with considerable duplication (most of which may be mitigated by ES6).

If anything, the case study validates the value of build steps and frameworks, but also demonstrates that standard web technologies can be used effectively and there are only a few critical areas where a vanilla approach is clearly inferior (especially in browser testing).

Books set in location offer readers and travellers the possibility to travel around the world and gain a unique insight into each destination and culture. It’s a unique way to travel as you visit a location seeing it through the eyes of the author and their characters. Actual travellers and Armchair travellers unite!

The BookTrail was set up to explore the world via books. By matching a  location with a good book, you can read a book set in the destination you’re headed to, or staying at home? Find a book set somewhere you would like to go.

TheBookTrail allows you to read your way around the world without taking a single step. But the real BookTrail experience is to take a book, visit the locations in it and see how the author captured this landscape in their novel, how the characters interact, where they live, work, meet…

<DD>Maps  have  long  been  been  used  to  visualise  estimates  of  spatial  variables,  in  particular  disease  burdenand risk.  Predictions made using a geostatistical model have uncertainty that typically varies spatially.However, this uncertainty is difficult to map with the estimate itself and is often not included as a result,thereby generating a potentially misleading sense of certainty about disease burden or other important vari-ables.  To remedy this, we propose simultaneously visualising predictions and their associated uncertaintywithin a single map by varying pixel size.  We illustrate our approach using examples of malaria incidence,but the method could be applied to predictions of any spatial continua with associated uncertainty

<DD>This is a fork of Mike Bostock's bivariate choropleth notebook that brings together a few variations on the original.

First, this notebook uses continuous color scales rather than the original quantile bins.

To best facilitate comparison between the two approaches to mapping data values to color, this notebook preserves the color schemes in the original notebook. It also gives you the option to create your own color scheme.

You can also vary the color interpolation function and select whether you scale values to colors linearly, according to data values, or ordinally, according to rank among values. (Both of these make a big differences! The original notebook this is forked from makes bins values ordinally, fyi.)

<DD>A Quantitative Approach to Colour Palette Selection

Choosing the right colours for information graphics and data visualisation is easier said than done. People with colour perception deficiencies or colour blindness may have trouble seeing the distinction between some of your colours, or your colour palette might not work best for the data you're trying to display.

This notebook introduces a few metrics that quantify properties of a colour palette so that given a set of palettes, it is possible to pick the &quot;best fit&quot; for the job.

If bike races are story generators, The Hell of the North is nearly Shakespearean, subjecting its actors to brutal pain, underdog victories... the rise, and inevitable fall, of cycling dynasties.

<DD>Here are the primary goals of creating this guide:

🏆 Serve as a resource for Python newcomers who prefer to learn hands-on. This repository has a collection of standalone modules which can be run in an IDE like PyCharm and in the browser like Repl.it. Even a plain old terminal will work with the examples. Most lines have carefully crafted comments which guide a reader through what the programs are doing step-by-step. Users are encouraged to modify source code anywhere as long as the main routines are not deleted and run successfully after each change.

🏆 Serve as a pure guide for those who want to revisit core Python concepts. Only builtin libraries are leveraged so that these concepts can be conveyed without the overhead of domain-specific concepts. As such, popular open-source libraries and frameworks (i.e. sqlalchemy, requests, pandas) are not installed. However, reading the source code in these frameworks is inspiring and highly encouraged if your goal is to become a true Pythonista.

<DD>The benefits in safety of this kind of helicopters are many compared with a traditional helicopter design, check the nest list of benefits over any other design.


    In first place they are a lot safer than any helicopter because this design don't need a tail rotor and being 86% of the fatal accidents in an helicopter caused by a fail of the tail rotor with just thus we eliminate 86% of the accidents.


    Since this helicopters don't produce torque and they don't need a tail rotor because the power is direct applied to the tips of the rotor blades, they are a lot easier to fly and with just a few hours of instruction they can be flown because this design is inherently more stable in flight and in hover than any tailed helicopter.


    The new generation of rocket engines designed and built by TAM will prevents 98% of maintenance costs because the new generation of rocket motors are virtually maintenance-free with just a self cleaning of the injectors with water and they will be ready to fly in all conditions, regardless of dust, sand or any weather phenomenon unlike a turbine that all this affects not only their performance but in its life.


    TAM's new engines having no moving parts eliminates 98% of engine failures.


    These rocket engines generate their own exhaust gases this way his performance is the same at any altitude, in fact its power increases with altitude with less resistance to air at a lower density, remember that rocket engines are designed to operate in the space where there is no atmosphere, so we don't have any limit of power at high altitude.

<DD>Using Microsoft Word with git

25 August 2014 by Martin Fenner

One of the major challenges of writing a journal article is to keep track of versions - both the different versions you create as the document progresses, and to merge in the changes made by your collaborators. For most academics Microsoft Word is the default writing tool, and it is both very good and very bad in this. Very good because the track changes feature makes it easy to see what has changed since the last version and who made the changes. Very bad because this feature is built around keeping everything in a single Word document, so that only one person can work on on a manuscript at a time. This usually means sending manuscripts around by email, and being very careful about not confusing different versions of the document, which requires creativity.

<DD>Modern statistical displays of data—grids of scatterplots for inspecting correlations, for example—succeed by being transparent and allowing trends in the data to stand out. In contrast, classic data visualizations often succeed, paradoxically, by being a bit opaque: a puzzle that a reader figures out.

Each word then must pass several criteria. Containing a number or special character is criteria for disqualification. To avoid proper nouns, all capitalized words are filtered.

The most important check is against the New York Time's archive search service. The archive goes back to 1851 and contains more than 13 million articles.

The paper publishes many thousands of words each day, but only a very few are firsts.

<DD>The engine takes unstructured input text, such as 'Neutral Bay North Sydney New South Wales' and attempts to deduce the geographic area the user is referring to.

Human beings (familiar with Australian geography) are able to quickly scan the text and establish that there 3 distinct token groups: 'Neutral Bay', 'North Sydney' &amp; 'New South Wales'.

The engine uses a similar technique to our brains, scanning across the text, cycling through a dictionary of learned terms and then trying to establish logical token groups.

Once token groups have been established, a reductive algorithm is used to ensure that the token groups are logical in a geographic context. We don't want to return New York City for a term such as 'nyc france', so we need to only return things called 'nyc' inside places called 'france'.

<DD>When you use this, you commit to updating incrementally regardless of what changed. Yet in practice, you tend to thinking about one specific thing changing — say a counter, or a dataset. Whereas when you use a side-effect cell, that cell is reacting only to the specific thing (its inputs); if anything else changes, the whole chart is redrawn from scratch (the non-incremental way).

In short, with a side-effect cell, you opt-in to specific incremental changes; with this, you must handle anything changing.

For example, say you use const canvas = this || DOM.canvas(width, height) to avoid creating a new canvas element and 2D context on redraw. In the normal case, you’re probably fine. But if the width or height ever changes, oops, you’ll have the wrong size canvas. (Some of the early D3 examples had this problem, and weren’t responsive as a result.)

A subtlety with the method I recommend is that the update function should be defined in the chart cell: the side-effect cell should only call the exposed update function, not reach into the chart and modify it directly. This way as you edit the update function, you’re invalidating the chart cell and the whole thing is redrawn from scratch. This avoids getting into a nondeterministic state from earlier versions of the code. Again, you’re opting-in minimally to just the thing you expect to change, and letting any other change happen through normal dataflow.

Whenever discussing problems with programming today and potential solutions, invariably someone will pop up and declare that the problem is obviously the fact that programs are linear text and if only programming were visual, all problems would immediately disappear in some unspecified way.

I understand the attraction of visual programming, particularly for visual thinkers. However, it's not as if this hasn't been tried, with so far very limited success. Brad Myers, in his 1989 paper Taxonomies of Visual Programming gave, along with the titular taxonomy, a non-exhaustive summary of the problems, starting with visual languages in general:

<DD>In 1795, Henry Carington Bowles released Bowles’s European Geographical Amusement, or Game of Geography, the latest in his family’s board game series. Allegedly based on a 1749 travelogue, “the Grand Tour of Europe, by Dr. Nugent,” it combined learned pretensions with simple rules. “Having agreed to make an elegant and instructive TOUR of EUROPE,” players took turns rolling an eight-sided “Totum” and moving their “Pillars” through the appropriate number of cities. Whoever returned to London first was “entitled to the applause of the company and honor of being esteemed the best instructed and speediest traveler”: an enviable but deceptive accolade. In fact, erudition and swiftness were inversely correlated in Bowles’s game; being “instructed” required that your Pillar be delayed.

<DD>ArchieML (or &quot;AML&quot;) was created at The New York Times to make it easier to write and edit structured text on deadline that could be rendered in web pages, or more specifically, rendered in interactive graphics.

One of the main goals was to make it easy to tag text as data, without having type a lot of special characters. Another goal was to allow the document to contain lots of notes and draft text that would not be read into the data. And finally, because we make extensive use of Google Documents's concurrent-editing features — while working on a graphic, we can have several reporters, editors and developers all pouring information into a single document — we wanted to have a format that could survive being edited by users who may never have seen ArchieML or any other markup language at all before.

<DD>Building a Company in 2020

I care deeply about how technology helps humans learn, connect, create and make better decisions. In 25+ years in tech, I've gone from developer, technical lead, engineering manager, then VP of Engineering. I went from leading teams of 2 - 3 developers to teams of over 1,000 distributed globally. Now I am building a team from scratch.

About a year and a half ago, I started my journey as Observable's co-founder and CEO. I am a single mom and I had someone very important (my daughter) in my life to consider... So what made me decide to turn my life upside-down? Helping developers, creators and anyone benefit from the power of visualization is a dream of mine. I was hooked after my work on open source and developer tools. But all the tools that have existed were too hard to use and never fully took advantage of the social nature of the Internet.

However, unlike lines, trails do not support different interpolation methods and use fill (not stroke) for their color. Trail marks are useful if one wishes to draw lines that change size to reflect the underlying data.”

The following code is extracted from Vega’s code base (src/path.trail.js) with minimal adaptation (Tau, path, and allowing constants for x, y and size), and can be used with D3 directly.

And we made sure that no technical skills were required.

<DD>Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, and software engineering. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus students’ choice of: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for web development); Java or Swift (for mobile app development); or Lua (for game development). Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.
